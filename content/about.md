### $ system --info
I am a performance-oriented Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience in designing and scaling service-oriented architectures for enterprise cloud platforms. 

My day-to-day involves building the future of context-based, cross-product and internal observability at SAP with the **[Cloud ALM NGDCI](https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal/data-collection-infrastructure.html)** team. I focus on building resilient systems, designing clean API contracts, and engineering high-throughput low latency systems for efficient data transfer. I’m currently looking for new backend opportunities in the **EU region**.

### $ run hobbies.exe
During covid, I decided to pick up learning the guitar. Since then it has been a constant focus of mine outside of the regular 9-5

I (try to) upload occasional snippets to my **[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@arnavdasgupta98)**. 
> **Note:** The channel is currently a massive Work-In-Progress (WIP). It has exactly one video to showcase the Minimal Viable Product of my music career.
